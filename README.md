FreeScout WooCommerce
=============

This is a module to display WooCommerce orders on the sidebar of a FreeScout conversation related to the current customer(based on the e-mail address).
The orders are stored for 1 hour and it will automatically refresh after that(you can also manually refresh if needed).

##### How it works?

1. Download the repo and copy it into the FreeScout's Modules folder(make sure the folder name is WooCommerce)
2. Enable the module in FreeScout
3. Go to Settings / WooCommerce and enter your domain name and API keys
4. Check out a conversation and it will automatically download the most recent orders of the customer and it will be displayed on the sidebar with a quick link to the order details page
